<h1>Maze Generator and Path Finder</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<br>In this project, I created a program that generates random mazes of size MxN and finds a unique path between designated entry and exit points within the maze. The program implements a stack using a linked list data structure, specifically as a template-based class. The maze generation involves knocking down walls iteratively until no unvisited cells remain, following specific rules for cell reachability. The path discovery mimics the maze generation process, ensuring a unique path is found between entry and exit points.

In the maze generation phase, K random mazes are generated with specified dimensions (MxN). In the path discovery phase, the program prompts the user to select a maze and input entry and exit points. The program then finds a unique path between these points and outputs the coordinates of the cells in an output file.

The program adheres to specific input requirements and file-naming conventions, providing a comprehensive solution for maze generation and path discovery with a focus on stack-based algorithms.
